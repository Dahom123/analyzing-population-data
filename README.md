Project analyzing Poulation data 
The Population Data Analysis Project is designed to analyze demographic data using basic SQL functions. This project provides insights into population trends and statistics through SQL queries and data visualizations.
Run the SQL queries to analyze the population data:
1. Connect to your database:
    ```sh
    psql -U username -d yourdatabase
    ```
2. Execute the queries in `queries.sql` to perform the analysis.
